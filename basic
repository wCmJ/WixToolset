WixUI
the library includes all standard wizard pages: license agreement, 
                                                customer information, 
                                                typical/custom/complete setup types,
                                                customization of install target folder,
                                                calculation of disk usage requirements,
                                                modify/repair/remove and rollback.


WixUI_Mondo:    
            complete interface, welcome page, license agreement, setup type(typical, custom and complete),
            allows for feature customization, browsing for the target directory and offers disk costing, maintenance mode dialog
WixUI_FeatureTree:
            similar to the full set but it doesnot allow the user to chose between setup types.
            it always assumes Custom and goes directly to the feature customization dialog after the user has accepted the license agreement.
WixUI_InstallDir: <Property Id="WIXUI_INSTALLDIR" Value="INSTALLDIR">
            allows the user to select a destination directory but without presenting the usual customized features page
WixUI_Minimal:
            license agreement pages
WixUI_Advanced:
            similar to WixUI_Minimal, it also allows selecting features and folders if the user chooses to do so
